# Match-A-Meal #
## Helping couples and groups decide what to eat ##

### Summary ###
  #### Match-A-Meal suggests options of where to eat, to two or more users individually. Each user reponds with a yes or no to each option presented. Once an option has received enough positive responses, a match is made and displayed to all users. ####

### Problem ###
  #### Often, people in groups have trouble deciding where they collectively want to eat from an array of choices. ####

### Solution ###
  #### Meal-A-Match facilitates this deliberation in two ways: first, focusing each user on one location at a time, with a simple positive or negative response; second, combining these responses to locations from users to return aggregate responses. ####
